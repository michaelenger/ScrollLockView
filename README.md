# ScrollLockView

A view that attaches itself to a `UIScrollView` and locks itself in place when the view is scrolled to reveal it.

_Inspired by: https://github.com/iStopped/PullToRefreshView_

![Example](https://raw.github.com/michaelenger/ScrollLockView/master/example.png)

## Usage

1. Download/clone the code: `git clone git@github.com:michaelenger/ScrollLockView.git`

2. Add `#import "ScrollLockView.h"` to the head of your ViewController class.

3. Create a `ScrollLockView` object and attach it to a scrollable view.
   ```objective-c
   - (id)init: {
   // ...

   // A full-sized text view
   UITextView *textView = [[UITextView alloc] initWithFrame:self.view.bounds];
   textView.text = @"Why, hello there!";
    
   // The lock view will be full width and 100px high.
   // It will also be attached above the scrollable view,
   // meaning the scrollable view needs to be scrolled down.
   ScrollLockView *lockView = [ScrollLockView viewWithHeight:100.0 aboveView:textView];
    
   // Make it red so we can see it
   lockView.backgroundColor = [UIColor redColor];
    
   // Add some buttons and junk
   //[lockView addSubview:[UIButton ...]];
   //[lockView addSubview:[UILabel ...]];
    
   // Add the scroll view to the main view
   [self.view addSubview:textView];

   // ...
   }
   ```

## ScrollLockView Class Reference

### Properties

#### delegate

The delegate of the object.

```@property (strong, nonatomic) id<ScrollLockViewDelegate> delegate```

#### lockThreshold

Threshold for locking the scroll-view. This is automatically generated when creating the object using one of the constructor methods, but can be overridden.

```@property (assign, nonatomic) CGPoint lockThreshold```

#### scrollOffset

The offset which the scroll-view will lock to. This is generated programatically every time the property is referenced, so
be vary of using it often. (read-only)

```@property (assign, nonatomic, readonly) CGPoint scrollOffset```

#### scrollView

The UIScrollView which the object should lock.

```@property (strong, nonatomic) UIScrollView *scrollView```

#### state

The state of the object, as defined by the "State" constants (see below). (read-only)

```@property (assign, nonatomic, readonly) ScrollLockViewState state```

#### type

The type of the object, which defines which side (above, below, left or right) the object is in relation to the scroll-view. This is defined in the "Type" constants table (see below). (read-only)

```@property (assign, nonatomic, readonly) ScrollLockViewType type```

### Class Methods

#### viewWithSize:aboveView:

Creates and initializes a view to be above a specified scroll-view.

```+ (ScrollLockView *)viewWithHeight:(float)size aboveView:(UIScrollView *)view```

 * **height** Height of the view to create
 * **view** Scroll-view to attach to

#### viewWithSize:belowView:

Creates and initializes a view to be below a specified scroll-view.

```+ (ScrollLockView *)viewWithHeight:(float)size belowView:(UIScrollView *)view```

 * **height** Height of the view to create
 * **view** Scroll-view to attach to

#### viewWithSize:leftOfView:

Creates and initializes a view to be to the left of a specified scroll-view.

```+ (ScrollLockView *)viewWithWidth:(float)size leftOfView:(UIScrollView *)view```

 * **width** Width of the view to create
 * **view** Scroll-view to attach to

#### viewWithSize:rightOfView:

Creates and initializes a view to be to the right of a specified scroll-view.

```+ (ScrollLockView *)viewWithWidth:(float)size rightOfView:(UIScrollView *)view```

 * **width** Width of the view to create
 * **view** Scroll-view to attach to

### Instance Methods

#### hide:

Hides the object, returning the scroll-view to it's 0x0 origin.

```- (void)hide:(BOOL)animated```

 * **animated** Whether the movement should be animated

#### hide:duration:

Also hides the object, but does so based on a certain duration. If the ```animation``` parameter is set to ```NO``` then the duration value will be ignored.

```- (void)hide:(BOOL)animated duration:(float)duration```

 * **animated** Whether the movement should be animated
 * **duration** The amount of seconds to spend animating

#### show:

Shows the object, moving the scroll-view to the position specified by the ```scrollOffset``` property.

```- (void)show:(BOOL)animated```

 * **animated** Whether the movement should be animated

#### show:duration:

Also shows the object, but does so based on a certain duration. If the ```animation``` parameter is set to ```NO``` then the duration value will be ignored.

```- (void)show:(BOOL)animated duration:(float)duration```

 * **animated** Whether the movement should be animated
 * **duration** The amount of seconds to spend animating

### Delegate Methods

#### scrollView:didHide:

The view was hidden.

```- (void)scrollView:(UIScrollView *)scrollView didHide:(ScrollLockView *)view```

 * **scrollView** The scroll-view attached to the hidden view
 * **view** The view which was hidden

#### scrollView:didLockToView:

The scroll-view was locked to a specific view

```- (void)scrollView:(UIScrollView *)scrollView didLockToView:(ScrollLockView *)view```

 * **scrollView** The scroll-view which was locked
 * **view** The view it was locked to

#### scrollView:didShow:

The view was shown.

```- (void)scrollView:(UIScrollView *)scrollView didShow:(ScrollLockView *)view```

 * **scrollView** The scroll-view attached to the shown view
 * **view** The view which was shown

#### scrollView:willHide:

A scroll-view is about to hide a view

```- (void)scrollView:(UIScrollView *)scrollView willHide:(ScrollLockView *)view```

 * **scrollView** The scroll-view attached to the view to be hidden
 * **view** The view to hide

#### scrollView:willShow:

A scroll-view is about to show a view

```- (void)scrollView:(UIScrollView *)scrollView willShow:(ScrollLockView *)view```

 * **scrollView** The scroll-view attached to the view to be shown
 * **view** The view to show

### Constants

#### State

The state the object is in, which determines whether or not it can be shown/hidden.

    typedef enum {
        ScrollLockViewStateNormal,
        ScrollLockViewStateLocking,
        ScrollLockViewStateLocked
    } ScrollLockViewState

 * **ScrollLockViewStateNormal** Normal (hidden) state
 * **ScrollLockViewStateLocking** In the process of locking the scroll-view
 * **ScrollLockViewStateLocked** Has locked the scroll-view

#### Type

The type of object determines which side it is on relative to the scroll-view. This will affect the ```scrollOffset``` and ```lockThreshold``` properties and is defined if one of the constructors are used.

    typedef enum {
        ScrollLockViewTypeAbove,
        ScrollLockViewTypeBelow,
        ScrollLockViewTypeLeft,
        ScrollLockViewTypeRight
    } ScrollLockViewType

 * **ScrollLockViewTypeAbove** View is above the scroll-view
 * **ScrollLockViewTypeBelow** View is below the scroll-view
 * **ScrollLockViewTypeLeft** View is to the left of the scroll-view
 * **ScrollLockViewTypeRight** View is to the right of the scroll-view
